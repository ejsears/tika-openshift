This is a sample example of an Apache Tika Server that will run in Openshift.

The files should be modified as necessary with correct route hostnames and image sources if the default
docker image from dockerhub is not desired.

The included Dockerfile can be built and used in lieu of pulling from Dockerhub with appropriate 
modifications to the remaining yaml files.
